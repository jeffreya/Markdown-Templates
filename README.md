# MarkDown Templates

This repo contains template MD files for providing technical writers with the information they need for a new API. 
It contains the following files: 
- In API-intro you provide: 
  - A description of the full API that focuses on the functionality the API provides within Wix (not how the Corvid dev or TPA will use it)
  - API Terminology
  - API Limitations
- In use-cases you provide: 
  - High-level scenarios for both TPA and Corvid users. The reason the TPA or Corvid dev wants to use this functionality (what they plan to build on top of the API).
- In error-codes you provide: A list of error codes and their long descriptions. Short descriptions are provided in the proto.
- In corvid-specfic-functions you provide: The list of parameters and their details for corvid-specific functions and return objects.
- In corvid-code-examples you provide: Simple and complex code examples for Corvid, including example name, description, and code.

Notes: 
>  - This repo is a template repo so you can use it as a template in the repo for your API.
>  - The files contain instructions as well as examples as placeholder text. Any text surrounded by angle brackets < > is meant to be replaced.
>  - We tried to keep the need to work with formatting to a minimum so you can focus on adding the content quickly.
>  - Please either copy/paste the sections in the files or create duplicates of these files as needed for your API.

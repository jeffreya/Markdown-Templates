# About the \<XXX\> API

< </br>
A description of the full API that focuses on the functionality the API provides within Wix (not how the Corvid dev or TPA will use it). </br> 
<br>**For example:**

Wix Stores creates a catalog of store owners’ items for purchase and allows store owners to create smaller collections of products by type or theme. A catalog organizes the store’s products and collections and facilitates inventory management. With the Wix Stores Catalog APIs you can query individual products, collections or the entire catalog, as well as create products and add their media. </br>

\>

## Terminology
< </br>
List of any general terms the writer needs to understand to document the API. Make sure to describe the individual entities and their relationships. </br>
</br>**For example:**

- **Catalog**: A complete list of all the store’s products that is compiled automatically.
- **Collections**: Themed groupings of items for purchase that a store owner can create to organize their products (e.g., Spring 2019, Running shoes, etc.). Products can belong to multiple collections. </br>

\>

## Limitations
< </br>**For example:**
	- Price discounts for collections apply to every item in that collection, no matter the item's price. 
	If the coupon sets a $10 discount and there is an $8 item in that collection, that item will be free when a 
	customer applies the coupon code.
	- Coupon codes are case and space sensitive. (We recommend instructing customers to copy and paste the
	coupon code without making any changes.) </br>
